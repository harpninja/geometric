# Eight point star
A while ago [someone I know](https://github.com/agware) showed me a d3 creation based on a design from the book [Islamic Geometric Designs](http://www.broug.com) by Eric Broug. Eventually got around to ordering my own copy of the book and decided to first code the [Eight point star design](http://www.animatedcreations.net/d3/geometric/8_point_star.html).
An article by [Paul Bourke](http://paulbourke.net/geometry/circlesphere/) was very helpful in creating this work.
Other designs:
* [Eight point star with rays](http://www.animatedcreations.net/d3/geometric/8_point_star_rays.html).
* [Octagon](http://www.animatedcreations.net/d3/geometric/octagon.html).
* [Fourfold pattern 3](http://www.animatedcreations.net/d3/geometric/fourfold_pattern_3.html).
